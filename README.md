This solution makes use of a Dictionary (or Key Value Map),doing so, this solution requires only one iteration of the number list, meaning a worst case run time of O(n)

1.at first we declared a dictionary to keep track of all the values

2.second we iterated over the entire array

3.then we subtracted the num from the target to search for its pair

4.if the pair is found, return the index of the both numbers

5.and we added a condition line to make sure we dont get the same index twice
